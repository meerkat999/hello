h1. Hello

Hello is a Ruby interface to a collection of the word "hello" in many languages and dialects.

I wrote it for Flickr-style messages after users sign in to a web application:

<pre><code>>> Hello.random
=> "Wushiwushi"</code></pre>

By default, the word you get is time-neutral and religious-neutral. It is intended to be directed at one person of any gender or any age. The "hello" may be formal or informal.

Expand the list of "hello"s by gender:

<pre><code>Hello.random(:gender => :male)
Hello.random(:gender => :female)</code></pre>

Expand the list of "hello"s by time of day:

<pre><code>Hello.random(:time => :morning)
Hello.random(:time => :afternoon)
Hello.random(:time => :evening)</code></pre>

Or combine them:

<pre><code>Hello.random(:time => :morning, :gender => :female)</code></pre>

Adjustments to the list are... welcome.
